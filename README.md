These scripts were supposed to be called by keyboard shortcuts configured in gnome, the shortcut will call a "Calling(...).sh" that will call the actual script itself, everything you be shown in a terminal window.
Also, the GitPullPLusPermit.sh is a script that make possible to update these scripts through this github repo, thats the script that you use to call Offgrade.sh
You use the keyboard shortcut to call CallingGitPull.sh, that calls GitPullPlusPermit, that update the scripts and give them executable permission and call Offgrade, that will run the others updates/upgrades.
